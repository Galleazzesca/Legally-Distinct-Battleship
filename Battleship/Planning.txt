Phase 1 - Planning & Structure
1. It will follow a standard Battleship structure with a 10x10 grid, 2 players, and 5 ships. The rules will be identical to normal battleship.
	- Each player will have a single board, they cannot see their ships after they place them.
	- Ships cannot rotate.
2. For the board I will be utilizing a simple 2D array of characters. 
	- E will represent blank spaces
	- The ships will be represented by the number of spaces they take up.
		- Maybe a struct for these?
	- X will represent hits
		- Will bw tracked by the board.
	- O will represent misses
		- Will bw tracked by the board.
3. I will have a main.cpp file where the actual program runs, a header file for my generic functions, one for board related functions (Displaying the board), and one for ship related functions (hit and miss fall under this category).
4. The program will first ask the user how many people are playing.
	- It will then ask each player to choose where there ships will be located, it will be cleared before the next person sees.
	- The ship locations will be stored internally, neither player will see them after they are inputted.
	- It will then go through a loop of asking each player to select a target (they will be chosen in the classic manner i.e. A1 or F9).
	- Once it finishes it will indicate who won.
